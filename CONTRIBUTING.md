# How to contribute

We are glad about contributions in any way, shape, or form.
If you have patches or new features, please consider creating a merge request.
We are also always happy to hear about projectes in which you have implemented 
your own plug-ins.


## Changes to the Core Framework

On a case-by-case basis we have to decide on whether to merge new branches
or whether to create preliminary topic branches for them.
Trivial changes are also always welcome.


## Plug-Ins

Most contributions to the cs::APEX ecosphere should be in the form of 
plug-ins that do not need extensions to the main framework. If you see the need
for changes anyhow, please consider letting us now early, since the project
is still under development and many internals do not yet have a stable API.


## Reporting Issues

We appreciate every posted issue for any kind of bug, failed assertion or
usability issue, as well as in the form of ideas and suggestions.
